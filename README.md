### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

To use the tip calculator, you will need to enter the bill amount, then the number of people then LASTLY the tip amount. For some reason that is the only way it will work. If you don't enter the information accordingly, NaN will be displayed as the tip calculation.


### Useful resources
