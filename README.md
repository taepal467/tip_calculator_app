### Continued development

As of 4/16/22 This project is incomplete. The JavaScript portion was too challenging for me but eventually I will comback and complete the project. I also need to work on the Mobile-first Workflow.



### Useful resources

- [StackOverFlow](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/css/input+type+number+drop+down+hide) - This helped me hide the drop down menu that's used for the <input type="number>.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
